You can play almost anywhere on the board.

However, there are some places where the rules prevent play.

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/illegal-1.sgf" description="Black can't make a move to A. (White can.)<br />For if Black plays there, that stone would already be surrounded.<br />Suicide is not allowed in Go.">}} 

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/illegal-2.sgf" description="However, Black can play on B.">}}


{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/illegal-3.sgf" description="With a black stone on B, the two white stones would be surrounded and captured. (See figure)">}}
