This shows us that it is possible to "cut" stones that are diagonally connected.

If the stones are cut into two parts, each part has to live separately - you will be in a difficult situation.

{{< challenge sgf="/sgfs/kiri2.sgf" description="Black has 30 points while White has 31 points. So it looks like White won by one point.</p><p>However, the territory on the underside it's not actually White's.</p><p>Just cut White's wall.">}}
