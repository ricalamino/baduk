### Board
Go is played on a board with an equal number of vertical and horizontal lines, including the lines that delimit the board. The most used boards are: 9×9, 13×13 and 19×19.

Below are the 9×9, 13×13 boards and, the most used board, 19×19 lines. If you are a beginner, it is advisable to start playing with the smallest.

### Stones

There are **black** and **white** stones. So the game is played by two players. The total number of stones in a 19×19 board game is 361 stones (181 **black** and 180 **white**).

The stones are small discs, but you can improvise with buttons or pieces from other games. They are placed at the intersections of the vertical and horizontal lines. To play on a 13x13 or 9x9 board you don't need as many pieces.
