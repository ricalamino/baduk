### Almost the end of the game

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/jogofim1.sgf" description="The diagram shows the game after the players have stopped playing.</p><p>We see the neutral territory points (1,2,3,4). They can be filled by either black or white (<strong>non</strong> pieces participating in the game).</p><p>The pieces marked with triangles are dead pieces (no chance of forming solid territory). They are removed from the board and placed together with captured ones.">}}

### End of the game

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/jogofim3.sgf" description="The pieces that are on the board are rearranged to facilitate counting.</p><p>The captured pieces are placed on the territory of the same color, also to facilitate the final count.</p><p>Now just count the intersections that are not filled by parts. If you don't remember, <a href='/end-game'>see here</a> how to count.</p><p>And finally, <strong>Black wins by 20 to 16</strong >.">}}
