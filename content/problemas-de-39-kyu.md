If, by chance, a group of your stones is surrounded, try to form a territory with them.

That is, try to make two eyes.

If you still don't understand the concept of two eyes, [click here](/making-two-eyes).

{{< freeplay sgf="/sgfs/falseeye0.sgf" description="Here you'll learn the concept of a <strong>false eye</strong> - it looks like an eye but it's not.<br />In the picture, does the black group have two eyes?<br />There is an eye at F5.<br />D5 appears to be another eye as it is surrounded by 4 black stones.<br />However, it is <strong>not</strong> an eye as C5 is in Atari and you have to connect it to D5.<br />So you only have one eye - which means death.<br />We call an eye like D5 a <strong>false eye</strong>.<br />Play freely to explore the possibilities.">}} 

{{< challenge sgf="/sgfs/falseeye1.sgf" description="Try not to make a false eye.">}}

{{< challenge sgf="/sgfs/falseeye2.sgf" description="Both eyes are still not very clear.">}}

{{< challenge sgf="/sgfs/falseeye3.sgf" description="Black is almost surrounded.<br />Try to live in this situation.">}}

For beginners, it can be very difficult to know if an eye is real or fake.
