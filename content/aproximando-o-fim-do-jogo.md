When the game comes to an end, and both sides already have their territories defined, all you have to do is delineate the borders of your territory clearly.

At this point, you should try to push the edge into enemy territory, increasing your territory as much as possible while reducing your opponent's.

{{< challenge sgf="/sgfs/yose1.sgf" description="Black occupies the left side and White controls the right side.</p><p>However, there are still some places where the boundaries are not clear . Where can you play that will enable the biggest territory profit?">}}

{{< challenge sgf="/sgfs/yose2.sgf" description="Black has the left side and white has the right side. The game is almost over.</p><p>But be careful until the game It's over for real!</p><p>Whites just played in D1.</p><p>If you ignore it, your precious territory will be invaded.">}}
