### Groups

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/tecn1.sgf" description="The union is strength in Go: two or more pieces can join together to form blocks. These blocks of pieces are called <strong>groups</strong> and they have as many freedoms as the sum of the freedoms of each piece that forms it.</p><p>Group A: <strong>11</strong> liberties.</p><p>Group B: <strong>14 </strong> liberties.</p><p>Group C: <strong>13</strong> liberties.">}}

### Groups being captured

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/tecn2.sgf" description="In the figure we can see examples of groups being captured. They are captured with the move <strong>1</strong> as they have lost all their freedom.">}}

### Groups already captured


{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/tecn3.sgf" description="The situation shown corresponds to the previous diagram but with the pieces already captured. These captured pieces will be placed at the end of the game to decrease the opponent's territory.">}}

### True Eyes X False Eyes


{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/tecn4.sgf" description="In the diagram you can see situations in which we can get the impression that the territories are completely secured. But we can see that if the <strong>White</ strong> play on the points marked with \"x\" (<strong>false eyes</strong>) they capture part of the <strong>Black</strong> stones and in a subsequent move they can play in the other \"hole\" and end up capturing all the opposing pieces.</p><p>This no longer happens in the examples at the bottom. If <strong>White</strong> plays in any of the holes (<strong>true eyes</strong> ) between <strong>Black</strong>, it would be characterized the suicide of the stone, which is not allowed in Go.">}}
