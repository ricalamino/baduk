### Semeai (mutual attack)

{{< challenge sgf="/sgfs/43K-1-semeai.sgf" description="It's Black's turn. Two groups surrounding each other.<br />Either the 3 black or the 3 white will triumph.">}}

As above, when white and black surround each other and neither group has 2 eyes, both sides try to fill the vacant spaces, or **freedoms**, to kill the opponent's stones.
This situation is called "**Semeai**" - mutual attack.

In the above problem, both sides have 3 freedoms. However, Black can kill White one move earlier because it was Black's turn to play.
If it was White's turn, they would win Semeai.
