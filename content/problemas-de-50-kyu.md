### Capture the Opponent's Stones in Atari!

You can click on the board and capture your opponent's stones.

If you see a mistake, keep trying until you find a solution.

Here, a 9 x 9 board is used. Typically, a 19 x 19 board is used.

The smallest is recommended for beginners.


{{< challenge sgf="/sgfs/50K-1.sgf" description="Black's turn. Capture the white stone in atari. ">}}

{{< challenge sgf="/sgfs/50K-2.sgf" description="Black's turn. Two white stones are in atari. Capture both in one move!">}}

{{< challenge sgf="/sgfs/50K-3.sgf" description="Black's turn. Even if there are other stones nearby, just do the same.">}}

Just repeat the problems until you fully understand them.

When you understand them, I grant you the level of 50 Kyu - the lowest level in my ranking system.

### About the Go ranking

In the amateur world of Go, 30 kyu is normally the lowest level. The lower the number, the stronger the player.

Above 1 kyu comes 1 dan. As the dan increases, the stronger it will become.

Players with Dan are considered the best.
