{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/tsukehane1.sgf" description="You play Black, as usual.</p><p>White places an E4 stone very close to you - this move is called \"<strong>touch</strong>\".</p><p>How should you respond to touch?">}}



{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/tsukehane2.sgf" description="In this case, Black's F4 move shown below is good.</p><p>This move decreases White's freedom from 3 to 2. </p><p>It's almost as if black is slapping white in the face.</p><p>Attack the attacker!">}}


{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/tsukehane3.sgf" description="Continuing the diagram above, if white played elsewhere like E7, black can continue attacking the white stone as below. Now the E4 stone is on the Atari - with one more move, you can capture her.">}}

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/tsukehane4.sgf" description="Continuing from the first figure, if black doesn't respond to white's touch and plays elsewhere like F7, how would white play?</p> <p>White will continue to attack by slapping black in the face.</p><p>Can you see that black E3 is in trouble?">}}

### It's time to practice!
