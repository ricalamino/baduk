Now you know that diagonally connected stones can be cut by the opponent. Before being cut, you can defend yourself.

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/defesa1.sgf" description="If white plays a cut on F6 here, two stones (F7 and E6) will be in danger.</p><p>That's why black must play defensively before the cut.</p><p>This is a <strong>connection</strong> move.">}}

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/defesa2.sgf" description="Here, after F6, black connects its stones tightly.</p><p>This is a <strong>direct connection</strong> . White will no longer be able to cut them.">}}

Below you can see an **indirect connection**.


{{< freeplay sgf="/sgfs/defesa3.sgf" description="White can of course play F6 , but he will be killed instantly with F5 . Please try to analyze him on the board.</p><p >The stones are virtually connected.</p><p>Play freely on the board.">}}

These types of indirect connections are played more elaborate than direct connections.

If you know exactly when to make an indirect connection, you're not a beginner anymore, that's for sure.

{{< freeplay sgf="/sgfs/defesa4.sgf" description="In the picture, black has two cutoff points at E5 and F4.</p><p>You may wonder which one will be cut... There is a good move which defends both weak points simultaneously!</p><p>Please make a move in F5. Now White can't play neither in E5 nor in F4. That's why F5 is a indirect connection to both.</p><p>Because of the form, this connection is called a <strong>trumpet connection</strong>.">}}
