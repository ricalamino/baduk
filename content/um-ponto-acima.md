Here, you will learn how to play when white and black stones are not directly attacking each other.

This is the time for you to make moves that strengthen your position, preparing for a future war or even taking some territory.

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/acima1.sgf" description="This move (D5) is called <strong>One Point Up</strong> (or <strong>Ikken tobi</strong>).</p ><p>The jump move for D5 is almost connected to D3. Therefore, such a move can be used in many ways such as attack, defense or escape.">}}

> No One Point Up move is a bad move.

> Do One Point Up if you have no idea where to play.

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/acima2.sgf" description="If White plays very close to his position, the One Point Up is well recommended.</p><p>This move defends your C3 stone while you increases your territory on the left.">}}

{{< diagram sgf="/sgfs/acima3.sgf" description="If you ignore White's approach move E3 and play in irrelevant places like G7, your C3 stone can be attacked from both sides.">}}
