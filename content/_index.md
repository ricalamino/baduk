### Here you will learn How To Play Go (Baduk or Weiqi).
Before you start, remember three basic rules:

- Two players (black and white) make moves by placing a stone on the board alternately.
- Stones must be placed at the intersection of vertical and horizontal lines.
- When the stone is placed, it cannot be moved, only under certain conditions it can be removed.
